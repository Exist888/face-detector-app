> The app concept was provided by ZTM. I implemented the API functionality, AI integration, authentication logic, database queries, and custom CSS. I also modernized the React and Express syntax, structured the backend using routes/controllers/services, and deployed using **Supabase**, **Fly.io**, and **Netlify**.
